Repository for iGEM Grenoble 2019 Engineering team

Our project’s goal is to represent the universities of Grenoble at the international synthesis biologycompetition iGEM. This competition will take place at the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technol-ogy) between the31stof October and the4thof November.Our project’s aim is to create a system able to detect the presence of biomarkers in small volumes ofnon-complex fluids (tears, sweat, urine...). This idea comes from a conference [1] given on June 2018by Mark Lew at the American Academy of Neurology’s 70th Annual Meeting, where he showedresults that a biomarker of Parkinson’s disease could be detected in the tears of a patient.After a few months of researches, we realized that the idea of having a system only able to detect abiomarker for Parkinson’s disease was a reducing perspective and an idea that posed ethical problemsas there are no treatment for this pathology.That is why we enlarged our project to aim at creating a device that could be easily adapted to thedetection of other biomarkers, and that could do it with as few manipulations from health techniciansas possible.Our project is then to create a system that automates the detection of all kind of biomarkers in reducedvolume.In order to clarify the project, we will focus on the detection of only one biomarker that we knowcould be of interest for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease: theα−synuclein. This protein formsoligomers which concentration increases in the tears of patients with Parkinson’s.
