Stock Rules (Copyright and Usage)

Here are the rules for using my stock both within the deviantART community, as well as outside of it. They are pretty simple and straightforward. If you have any questions or concerns, just leave me a comment or send me a note within deviantART. If you do not have a deviantART account, you can also send me your questions or concerns in an email at rjdezigns.art@gmail.com. 

• YOU MUST CREDIT ME WHENEVER YOU USE MY STOCK BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF deviantART.

• I’d appreciate it if you’d leave me a comment with a link to your deviations as I'd love to see where and how you use my stock! 

• Kindly provide me with a link (either in a note or comment within deviantART) as to where have you used my stock resources outside of deviantART. If you do not have a deviantART account, please email me the link at rjdezigns.art@gmail.com.


*************************************************************************************************************


WHAT YOU CANNOT DO WITH MY STOCK:

• NONE OF MY STOCK RESOURCES may be used in pornographic, fraudulent, obscene, immoral, infringing, illegal, blasphemous or defamatory materials in any way, or in a way that violates any law, regulation or statute in an applicable jurisdiction. No exceptions.

• YOU MAY NOT redistribute any of the files I offer on any other website or blog for download, or post/share my stock on an electronic bulletin board, FTP, or any file sharing programs. Please link back to the page that the download link is located on (NOT the file download link itself) and/or my deviantART profile for others to download and use the resources I provide. Again, no exceptions.

• YOU MAY NOT claim any of my work as your own, though you are welcome to learn from the files and create your own derivatives.

• YOU ALSO MAY NOT sell or give away any of my resources on any other stock site in whole or in part in any way. They are already free.
